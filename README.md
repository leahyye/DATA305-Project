# DATA305-Project

Developed a deep learning model that predicts whether a peptide has anticancer activity based on its FASTA sequence. A train set is used for model development, and a test set is used for evaluation. Each dataset contains two columns: FASTA, which holds the peptide sequences using standard amino acid codes, and label, where 1 indicates an anticancer peptide (ACP) and 0 indicates a non-ACP. 

## About the dataset 

Anticancer peptides (ACPs) are short chains of amino acids, typically 5 to 50 residues long, that can selectively target and kill cancer cells while minimizing harm to normal cells. They often work by disrupting cancer cell membranes or triggering apoptosis and are less prone to resistance than traditional drugs. ACPs can be naturally derived or synthetically designed, making them promising candidates for targeted cancer therapies. In computational biology, ACPs are represented in the FASTA format using standard single-letter amino acid codes. With 20 standard amino acids, the number of possible sequences grows exponentially with length, making the identification and design of effective ACPs a complex but promising area of research.
